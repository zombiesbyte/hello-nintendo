# Hello Nintendo

## Attract Mode Theme

### YouTube Video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9e8xJY-XY0

A layout based on the original Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). The layout uses a custom grid navigation system and provides a multitude of optional parameters to customise your experience.

The layout code should be fairly straight forward to follow if your a newbie to Squirrel programming language and Attract Mode theme/layout building. Even if you do not want to do anything with the code then you can use your own assets to change things up such as telling the them to use 3dboxes as shown in the video showcase or swap out a similar image in the parts folder.
